			<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Hi everyone \\^-^// my name is Elizabeth, but you may call me Liz. I am currently a sophomore in the College of Arts and Science at NYU studying Economics with a potential double minor in Web Design and Chinese Language. In my spare time, I enjoy <a href="interests.html#anime">reading manga/watching anime</a>, <a href="interests.html#art">making art</a>, <a href="interests.html#travel">traveling</a>, and <a href="interests.html#sports">exercising.</a></p>

				<p>One thing I want to try getting more into would be reading in my spare time. For example, one of the books my cousin Mely recommended to me was the book called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62047984-yellowface">Yellowface by R.F. Kuang</a> as well as a book called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4865.How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People">How to Win Friends & Influence People by Dale Carnegie</a>.</p>

				<p>To begin, I am a Chinese American who was born in New York City and grew up in Massachusetts. I have two younger sisters and we all make art and play sports</p>
