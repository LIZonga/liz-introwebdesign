				<h3>Kaplan</h3>
				<p>One of my current roles is being Kaplan's Student Brand Ambassador. Here, I presented 10-minute pitches to 5-10 clubs at NYU towards making education more accessible through Kaplanâ€™s Free Resources. I have also organized tabling events at club fairs and institution wide events to create hundreds of leads to meet spring campaign goals. My goal was to market LSAT/MCAT/GMAT/GRE preparatory packages and scholarships across campus.</p>

				<p>On NYU's campus, I am an active member of the Class Activities Board as their Vice President of Finance. Here, I have helped engage the entire NYU Sophomore class (5,700+ students) in joining fun events planned by the Class Activities Board including laser tag and dances via marketing and consistent communicative emails. Additionally, I have utilized and appropriately budgeted club funds to effectively allocate towards weekly event items (giveaways, food, and beverages).</p>
