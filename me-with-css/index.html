				<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>Hi everyone \\^-^// my name is <span class="name">Elizabeth</span>, but you may call me <span class="name">Liz</span>. I am currently a sophomore in the College of Arts and Science at NYU studying Economics with a potential double minor in Web Design and Chinese Language. In my spare time, I enjoy <a href="interests.html#anime">reading manga/watching anime</a>, <a href="interests.html#art">making art</a>, <a href="interests.html#travel">traveling</a>, and <a href="interests.html#sports">exercising</a>.</p>

					<p>One thing I want to try getting more into would be reading in my spare time. For example, one of the books my cousin Mely recommended to me was the book called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62047984-yellowface">Yellowface by R.F. Kuang</a> as well as a book called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4865.How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People">How to Win Friends & Influence People by Dale Carnegie</a>.</p>
