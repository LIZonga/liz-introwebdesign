					<p>I love using watercolor paints as well as Pen and Ink. The above piece was part of my larger portfolio. It is one of my favorite ones. Another thing I enjoy drawing are logos and simple captures of everyday life. For example, I used to make a lot of portraits for friends and family.</p>

					<p>I use these <a href="experiences.html" title="Access the experiences page">experiences</a> to build my creative repetoire as I aspire to enter into the marketing industry.</p>

					<h3 id="travel">Traveling the World</h3>

					<p>My dream in the future is to travel all around the world and go on a food tour with my sisters. My family loves to take a really big trip together every summer. One of the places that I really want to go to one day is <span class="location">Greenland</span> or <span class="location">Switzerland</span> because I heard it is a very beautiful location.</p>

					<p>Additionally, I plan on studying a summer abroad in <span class="location">NYU Shanghai</span>.</p>

					<p>As a college student living in the city, me and my friends often try new foods so here is a list of places I want to try!</p>

					<h3 id=sports>Exercise</h3>
					<p>In the past, I have swam on both the high school varsity swim team in which we won Hockmock Championships every year and I placed tenth in the state for the 100 butterfly. Additionally, I swam competitively on the BlueFish Swim Club located in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Attleboro,+MA/@41.939835,-71.4591046,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e45df97249b007:0xc9801dee522f4720!8m2!3d41.9445441!4d-71.2856082!16zL20vMHR5bHE?entry=ttu"><span class="location">Attleboro</span></a>. After the pandemic and going into college, I left my swimming career and have recently begun exercising well and taking better care of my health.</p>
