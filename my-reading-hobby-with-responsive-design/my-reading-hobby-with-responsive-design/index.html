          <h3 id="mangahead">Manga</h3>
          <p id="mangadef">There is one called Manga, which is a Japanese-style comic book series that was popularized between 1950 to 1969. It is formally described as, “ an umbrella term for a wide variety of comic books and graphic novels originally produced and published in Japan. Unlike American comic books, which are usually printed in full color, Japanese manga are almost always published in black and white”. There have been many occasions where amazing mangas have been adapted into anime with high-quality production.</p>
